This is a collection of tabletop games I have created in JS with algorithms to solve them

%Sodoku
Backtracking is used here to solve the Sudoku game. This can be seen by clicking the solve button

%Reversi
Also known as Othello. This game uses a version of Heuristic Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning. The search depth can be adjusted resulting in a tradeoff between speed and solution quality. 

%Backgammon
This uses a basic heuristic evaluation strategy to pick moves.
